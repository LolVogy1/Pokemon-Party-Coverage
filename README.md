# Pokemon-Party-Coverage

This is currently a work in progress

This is an appplication that will let you enter the types of each of the Pokemon in your party and give you the type coverages

Type coverages include:


All types your party has super effective moves (assuming each pokemon has at least one attacking move of its type(s))

All types that your party defends against

All missing types for the above


This project is done in Java using JavaFX as the GUI

In the future I may try to add the ability to enter individual pokemon (if I can figure out how to access that data).

There are simiilar projects available but my brain is too small to understand it so I'm making something that works for me.
